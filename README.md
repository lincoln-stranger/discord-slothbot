# discord-slothbot
Simple discord bot in python to get practice for a more in-depth discord bot.

# Use
I did not include a .env file that contains my bot's token but that can be easily set up:

This is all that is in my .env as of this simple first workign version.

`DISCORD_TOKEN=<your-bots-token-here>`

The bot is most simply run out of the terminal:
`python slothbot.py`

Once the bot is running it will show as active in discord and then can be interacted with in the server via the command
`!fact`

# Roadmap
I most likely won't be working on Reginald (my bot's name) much more. But if I have time and the motivation here's what I might add:

- More commands (e.g. perhaps !pic gives you a random sloth picture)
  -  Possibly these or the facts can be scraped from somewhere instead of randomly chosen from a database
- Finding a way to containerize Reginald or run him from a rasberry pi to increase uptime
